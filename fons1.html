    <div class="one">
        <h1>Interesting anime Facts:<br /></h1>
        <div class="gl"><h3>"One-Punch Man"<br /></h3></div>
        <div class="gl">1. One-Punch Man started working on the Internet, moved to paper, then to the screen.<br /></div>
        A bit of history. Your introduction to One-Punch Man was most likely through the famous anime series, but the manga began as a webcomic. Created anonymously under the name manga artist ONE, the comic, launched in early 2009, received almost 8 million views by June 2012. You can read it here if you know Japanese. Like many web models, the art of One-Punch Man gets better as it goes on.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">2. There is a reason why One-Punch Man's equipment is so simple.<br /></div>
        While other super heroes receive wardrobes full of luxurious outfits, they are covered with spikes, chains and armor made of titanium, Saitama wanders the world in a simple suit. Yellow overalls, red boots and gloves, even his bald head and thin eyebrows make him no ordinary hero. This was done intentionally. ONE (mangaka) made this One-Punch Man design because there are already so many cool characters. Instead of focusing on the flashy look, the author believed that his character should come from who they don't look like.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">3. His outfit is a subtle tribute to his beloved Japanese character.<br /></div>
        Besides the fact that One-Punch Man looks unassuming, the character's outfit also serves as a tribute to a beloved children's character. Anpanman, a superhero with a jelly cookie head, starred in the manga, which was released from 1973 to 2013, and in the anime, which debuted in 1988 and is still being released. If you look at One-Punch Man's gear, you'll see that it's just a color version of Anpanman. In addition, the two characters share names that clearly explain the premise of their abilities.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">4. By keeping a Child with a "dimple in his chin" alive, Saitama changed the world.<br /></div>
        In episode 1 of the anime and in chapter 2 of the manga, fans are introduced to a generously named Child with a "dimple", with a chin that bears a striking resemblance to testicles. After drawing a pair of nipples on a sleeping Crabrante (the character is a humanoid crab), the little one's life becomes in danger after the monster attacks him. Saitama's intervention before he officially became a hero is the only thing that saves his life. Few people knew that the boy was the grandson of the multi-millionaire Agoni, who was so inspired by Saitama's act, which forms an Association of Heroes.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">5. One-Puncn Man is theoretically as fast as the speed of light.<br /></div>
        During the season 1 finale, Saitama finds himself face to face with Boros, a creature almost as strong as he is. Boros hits Saitama hard, he flies away from Earth to the Moon, only to discover that Saitama can return to Earth on his own in about 1.5 seconds. If the Earth is located at a distance of about 384 thousand km from the Moon, and it took 1.5 seconds to return to Earth, then Saitama returned at a speed of 256 thousand km per second. The speed of light is approximately 300 thousand km per second. Considering that Saitama just jumped and didn't charge or strain, it's easy to assume that his actual maximum speed when he actually tries might be pretty close to the speed of light. Right before Boros dies, he exclaims that the hero is not using his full strength.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">6. Threats in the world of One-Punch Man are measured at five different levels.<br /></div>
        The first level is the wolf, which means the appearance of a standard threat that requires one B-class hero or three C-class heroes ranked by the Hero Association to win. The Tiger class is a threat that threatens many lives, requiring one Class A hero or five Class B heroes to win. The threat of demons puts an entire city at risk by requiring 10 A-class heroes or 1 S-class hero to win. The next level is the Dragon level, as a result of which many cities are at risk of destruction. There is no standard for these threats, but we know that One-Punch Man can handle them. Finally, a God-level threat threatens all of humanity. It is debatable whether Boros is considered a God-level threat.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">7. Training One-Punch Man may not make you the most powerful being on Earth, but it will really be useful for you.<br /></div>
        In one episode, the hero discovered the secret of how he stays in shape. His secret? Do 100 push-ups, 100 squats, 100 abs and 10 km of running every day, 52 weeks a year. This workout is a combination of core workout, leg workout and cardio that uses a wider range of your muscle groups than those that just work out every day. The only downside is that you won't build a ton of muscle, due to the lack of strength training exceeding your normal body weight. On the other hand, this explains why One-Punch Man is not pumped. His work is designed for meager strength.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">8. Saitama is a fan of his creator's other work.<br /></div>
        In One-Punch Man 200 yen, an additional chapter included in one volume of the manga, we see Saitama as a weak child who loses fights and gets into trouble at school. During one of these scenes, he is depicted wearing a Mob Psycho 1,000,000 shirt. Again in Mob Psycho 100, Saitama appears in the dream sequence in Mob Psycho 100, chapter 80.5.<br />
        <br />

        <div class="gl"><h3>"The Chainsaw Man"<br /></h3></div>
        <div class="gl">1.</div> "The Man with the Chainsaw" is set in 1997.<br />
        This is a particularly curious choice, given that the author Tatsuki Fujimoto was born either in 1992 or in 1993, that is, at the time of the events of the series, he was still a child. Thus, unlike some other screenwriters, he does not just describe the events of his childhood.<br />
        Perhaps this is why many of the characters in the series smoke. Although smoking is still common in Japan, it has become less popular since the 90s.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">2.</div>  In chapter 259 of Kohei Horikoshi's book "My Hero Academy" there is a shot with a group of heroes standing around. It's easy to miss, since there's so much going on in the frame, but Denji is right there in the crowd, in his reincarnation of a Man with a Chainsaw.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">3.</div> When Gun Devil victims are listed, there are several canonical characters among them. But there are also several famous manga artists from the real world. Among them were Satoru Noda ("Golden Kamui"), Yuki Tabata ("Black Clover"), Kohei Horikoshi ("My Hero's Academy"), Eichiro Oda ("One Piece"), Hajime Isayama ("Attack on Titan") and Tait Kubo ("Bleach").<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">4.</div>  Denji went through many difficulties before Pochita merged with his body. He suffered from malnutrition, lack of shelter, and was constantly injured in battles with demons. But the darkest aspect of his situation was heart disease, which often caused him to have circulatory problems.<br />
        It was probably this disease that caused his mother's death. This means that even if the rest of his life had turned out well, without Honor, Denji might not have had a full life.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">5.</div>  Despite Denji's romantic and sexual attraction to Makima, he is also clearly looking for a maternal image in her. Fujimoto confirms this interpretation by pointing out something a little disturbing about Makima's name.<br />
        "By the way, wasn't the chainsaw originally intended for sawing wood? If you remove "ki" from "Makima", you get "mom". Denji has always aspired to motherhood."<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">6.</div>  The name of Power sounds pretty simple - it's another word for power. It turns out that Power's name is a bit more complicated. Her name is a reference to one of the middle ranks of angels in Christian mythology.<br />
        She's not the only demon whose name has an angelic connection. Bim, Galgali, Princi, Seraphim, Dominion, Angel and Virtue have names that are somehow associated with angelic orders - and all these characters are followers of the Chainsaw Man to one degree or another.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">7.</div>  Anime fans haven't met Reza yet, so this is just for manga fans.<br />
        Reza, also known as the Bomb Devil, is a young woman who has merged with the Bomb Devil and can turn parts of her body into bombs and detonate them as a result. Fujimoto once said that the idea for a storyline about her came to him from the 1998 film "Jin Ro," which begins with a girl committing a suicide bombing. The pose that Reza assumes when activating her ability is even similar to a scene from Jin Ro.<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">8.</div>  Kobeni is still alive and well, but maybe that wasn't the case. Fujimoto asked his editor Shihei Lin if he should end Kobeni or the Devil Angel. Lin said they didn't want the "Devil Angel" to die the way Fujimoto planned and thought Kobeni should die instead.<br />
        Fujimoto then turned around and did the opposite of what his editor had asked. We can only guess how Lin reacted to this!<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">9.</div>  Becoming an artist is a difficult task that requires many years of study and practice. Fujimoto did not study drawing in a formal setting - instead, he studied oil painting. It might be interesting for all of you artists, but for everyone else, the fact that he fantasized about destroying his classmates certainly stands out.<br />
        “... I also studied oil painting in college, and since I entered through the admissions committee [unlike the entrance exams], I did not paint from nature. Even now, I've only drawn a few of them. When you paint with oil, you mostly focus on touch, so my drawing skills haven't really improved.”<br />
        <br />
        “There were no preparatory schools nearby, so I went to an art lesson with a lot of older people, where I painted in oil in the corner. There were good artists there, and I decided that if I didn't get better at them in four years, I would kill them, and since I didn't want to go on the run, if I was a good artist, I just kept painting. After that, I didn't get any better at oil painting, so I holed up in the library and drew such gestural drawings.… I really should have done the drawings from nature. I really regret that I didn't do any. As soon as I finish serializing, I'll do it.”<br />
        <br />
        <div class="gl">10.</div>  Makima is a pretty unique character, but she is at least partially inspired by Benten from the "Eccentric Family". Fujimoto said,<br />
        “I like Benten's character in The Eccentric Family (based on the novel by Tomihiko Morimi) because she is an incomprehensible being who is above people, but she has her own sadness, but we ordinary people cannot be near her sadness... I'm loving it. It would be great if we could show this in Makim as well.”<br />
        <br />
        Benten is not nearly as dangerous as Makima, but she has a similar atmosphere. In addition, Yasaburo, the main character of The Eccentric Family, is obsessed with Benten to his detriment, in much the same way as Denji treats Makima.<br />
